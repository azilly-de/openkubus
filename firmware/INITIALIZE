Firmware:
  Make sure your hardware is already working and you have successfully flashed
  the firmware into the microcontroller. If you haven't done so yet, please do so
  and go to firmware/secstick_v1 or firmware/secstick_v2 (according to your
  firmware) and follow the instructions in README.

Description:
  The firmware is on your stick, but you still have to "personalize" it, get
  your own password on it. This password is like a seed, it will be used to
  generate the one time passwords. So make sure, nobody sees this password.

  At the moment there is only a simple command-line tool available to write a
  password to your stick. Have a look at firmware/create-stick/.
