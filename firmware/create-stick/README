Description:
  This tool writes the initial password (you may think of it as a seed) to the
  stick. For further information have a look at 
  > ./stick-write -h
  Make sure that the firmware is already flashed on your stick. If you haven't
  done so yet, go to firmware/secstick_v1 or firmware/secstick_v2 (according to
  your hardware).

Compiling:
  To compile the program, you'll need gcc, make and libusb development files.
  To compile it, just run:
  > make

Locking:
  If you run ./stick-write with the parameter -l your stick will be locked,
  i.e. you will no longer be able to write new passwords to the stick via USB.
  But you will still be able to reset the stick. Just erase the EEPROM (e.g. by
  flashing the firmware again) and your stick will be unlocked. This lock only
  prevents other computers (by accident or on purpose) to overwrite your
  password on the stick. So you should lock you stick once everything works.

Lock-Bits:
  If you want a stronger lock mechanism, have a look at the lock bits of the
  Atmega16u4. It is possible to prohibit every external reading and writing to
  the mc's flash and EEPROM. But make sure, the simple USB-lock is also set.
