Description:
  This is the OpenKubus library that runs on your computer. It gives you a
  simple function to validate one-time-passwords:
  
  int openkubus_authenticate(const char *pad, const char *pw, int offset, int num);

  const char *pad:  one-time-password, you want to check
  const char *pw:   initial-password (or seed)
  int offset:       offset
  int num:          sequence number

  You'll find further information to the concept and architecture of OpenKubus
  on the project's website at http://code.google.com/p/openkubus/.
