Description:
  This file contains the firmware for OpenKubus hardware rev 2.
  For detail information on the hardware (Rev. 2), have a look at the boards/
  directory. 
  The firmware uses the LUFA USB stack. This stack is MIT licenced. Have a look
  at the project page at http://code.google.com/p/lufa-lib/ and
  http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/LUFA.php for further information.

  
Compiling:
  You will need the GNU tool chain for AVR microcontrollers and make. If you
  use a linux distributions, check out if there are binary packages available.
  (For Debian and Ubuntu users: You will need to install avr-libc, avrdude,
  binutils-avr, gcc-avr and make)
  The atmega16u4 is quite young, so it may be neccessary to install a recent
  version of the cross utils. (June 2009)

  Before you try to compile the firmware, make sure you have already compiled
  the crypto-lib. If you haven't, go to ../crypto-lib/ and type make to compile
  it.

  > make
  should now compile your firmware. If compiling was successfull, there should
  be a file "openkubus.bin" in your directory.


Flashing:
  If you have the right fuses
  > make download
  should flash the firmware into the microcontroller.


From here:
  Your hardware is ready and waits to be initialized. Have a look at
  firmware/INITIALIZE for further information.
