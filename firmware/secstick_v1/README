Description:
  This file contains the firmware for the usbprog version of the OpenKubus
  stick. It also a USB stack for the USBN960x: usbn2mc
  For detail information on the hardware (Rev. 1), have a look at the boards/
  directory. 

  
Compiling:
  You will need the GNU tool chain for AVR microcontrollers and make. If you
  use a linux distributions, check out if there are binary packages available.
  (For Debian and Ubuntu users: You will need to install avr-libc, avrdude,
  binutils-avr, gcc-avr and make)

  Before you try to compile the firmware, make sure you have already compiled
  the crypto-lib. If you haven't, go to ../crypto-lib/ and type make to compile
  it.

  > make
  should now compile your firmware. If compiling was successfull, there should
  be a file "openkubus.bin" in your directory.


Flashing:
  There are two ways to copy the binary from your PC to the microcontroller:
    i)  If you want to flash the firmware to a usbprog, a simple
        > usprog_download:
        should flash the firmware
    ii) If you don't use the usbprog version, you'll need a programmer like
        Atmel mk2 or usbprog. First, set the right fuses:
        > make fuse
        Afterwards, you should be able to flash the firmware:
        > make download


Lockbits:
  If you do not whish that you or someone else can read or write the FLASH or
  EEPROM of the stick with a programmer anymore, use:
  > make lockbits
  Warning: You will still be able to configure the stick, but you will no
  longer be able to modify the firmware in any way. Be carefull!

From here:
  Your hardware is ready and waits to be initialized. Have a look at
  firmware/initialize for further information.
